<h1 style="color:yellow;">🗂️ File Explorer Project</h1>

File Explorer in C++
This project is a lightweight File Explorer application built in C++, designed to provide basic file management capabilities through a simple graphical interface or command-line interaction (depending on your implementation). It mimics core functionalities of traditional file explorers, allowing users to navigate directories, view file details, and perform operations like copy, move, delete, and rename.
✨ Features
- 📁 Browse and navigate through directories
- 📄 View file metadata (name, size, type, last modified)
- ✂️ Perform file operations: copy, move, delete, rename
- 🔍 Search for files by name or extension
- 🧵 Modular design using C++ classe and headers

  🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++17 (or later)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File system APIs (<filesystem> or platform-specific)
- Optional: WinAPI or Qt for GUI (if implemented)
🚀 Getting Started
To run the project:
- Clone the repository
- Compile using your preferred C++ compiler
- Run the executable and explore your file system
📦 Files Included
- main.cpp: Entry point of the application
- FileManager.cpp / FileManager.hpp: Core logic for file operations
- FileExplorer.exe: Compiled executable (Windows)
- Readme.md: Project documentation
